Los documentos de investigación recientes obtenidos de Scopus ilustran esta complejidad, abordando temas como el riesgo energético, la innovación tecnológica, la inversión extranjera, la economía circular y el impacto del turismo. Estos estudios no solo resaltan los desafíos actuales, sino también las oportunidades para las empresas que buscan ser sostenibles y competitivas.\\n\\nUn artículo clave examina cómo el riesgo energético impacta el turismo en Europa. Este estudio, aunque no se enfoca directamente en la gestión empresarial, subraya la importancia de la planificación estratégica y la gestión de riesgos en las empresas, especialmente en industrias susceptibles a factores externos como la volatilidad de los precios de la energía. Las empresas deben estar preparadas para anticipar y mitigar los riesgos para asegurar su continuidad y estabilidad.\\n\\nOtro conjunto de investigaciones se centra en la sostenibilidad y la innovación tecnológica. Un estudio analiza el papel de las innovaciones tecnológicas y la energía limpia en la neutralidad de carbono en Túnez. Este estudio es crucial para la gestión empresarial, ya que destaca cómo las empresas pueden adaptarse a los objetivos de sostenibilidad e integrar tecnologías verdes en sus operaciones. La adopción de prácticas sostenibles no solo contribuye a la responsabilidad social corporativa, sino que también puede generar ventajas competitivas.\\n\\nAdemás, se examina cómo la inversión extranjera directa (IED) influye en la relación entre los impuestos verdes y las tecnologías de energía verde. Este hallazgo es significativo para la gestión empresarial, ya que demuestra cómo las estrategias de inversión y las políticas gubernamentales pueden fomentar la adopción de prácticas sostenibles. Las empresas pueden beneficiarse de las políticas que incentivan la inversión en tecnologías limpias y sostenibles.\\n\\nLa economía circular es otro tema clave abordado por una revisión bibliométrica de la investigación en economías emergentes. Este estudio proporciona una visión valiosa sobre cómo las empresas pueden adoptar modelos de economía circular para reducir el desperdicio, mejorar la eficiencia de los recursos y crear nuevas oportunidades de negocio. La implementación de estos modelos es esencial para la sostenibilidad a largo plazo y puede mejorar significativamente la competitividad empresarial.\\n\\nFinalmente, un estudio analiza los efectos dinámicos del turismo en las emisiones de carbono en Indonesia. Este estudio es particularmente relevante para el sector turístico, destacando la necesidad de prácticas turísticas sostenibles y estrategias para mitigar los impactos ambientales. Las empresas del sector turístico deben adoptar medidas que aseguren la viabilidad a largo plazo de la industria y la protección del medio ambiente.\\n\\nEn conclusión, estos cinco documentos de investigación proporcionan una visión integral de los desafíos y oportunidades en la gestión empresarial actual. Desde la gestión de riesgos y la adopción de prácticas sostenibles hasta la innovación tecnológica y la economía circular, las empresas deben adaptarse continuamente para mantenerse competitivas y responsables en un mundo en constante cambio.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of\\\\nthe different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus\\\\non how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language\\\\nModels (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive\\\\ncontent within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which\\\\nsocial media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social\\\\nimpact. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language\\\\nmodels-highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for\\\\nabusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful\\\\ncontent. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on online\\\\nsafety and ethics, offering insights into the evolving landscape of cyberabuse\\\\nand the technological innovations that both mitigate and exacerbate it.\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 9, 18, 55, 50, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), \\'journal_ref\\': None, \\'doi\\': None, \\'primary_category\\': \\'cs.CL\\', \\'categories\\': [\\'cs.CL\\', \\'cs.AI\\'], \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05443v1\\', \\'arxiv_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05443v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Using LLMs to Infer Non-Binary COVID-19 Sentiments of Chinese Micro-bloggers\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Jerry Chongyi Hu\\', \\'Mohammed Shahid Modi\\', \\'Boleslaw K.

We study\\\\nWeibo, the most popular microblogging site in China, using posts made during\\\\nthe outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. The study period includes the pre-COVID-19\\\\nstage, the outbreak stage, and the early stage of epidemic prevention. We use\\\\nLlama 3 8B, a Large Language Model, to analyze users\\' sentiments on the\\\\nplatform by classifying them into positive, negative, sarcastic, and neutral\\\\ncategories. Analyzing sentiment shifts on Weibo provides insights into how\\\\nsocial events and government actions influence public opinion. This study\\\\ncontributes to understanding the dynamics of social sentiments during health\\\\ncrises, fulfilling a gap in sentiment analysis for Chinese platforms.

However, research on bias in code generation remains\\\\nlimited. Existing studies typically assess bias by applying malicious prompts\\\\nor reapply tasks and dataset for discriminative models. Given that LLMs are\\\\noften aligned with human values and that prior datasets are not fully optimized\\\\nfor code-related tasks, there is a pressing need for benchmarks specifically\\\\ndesigned for evaluating code models. In this study, we introduce FairCode, a\\\\nnovel benchmark for evaluating bias in code generation. FairCode comprises two\\\\ntasks: function implementation and test case generation, each evaluating social\\\\nbias through diverse scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new metric,\\\\nFairScore, to assess model performance on this benchmark. We conduct\\\\nexperiments on widely used LLMs and provide a comprehensive analysis of the\\\\nresults. The findings reveal that all tested LLMs exhibit bias.

However,\\\\nattackers may steal those valuable RAGs and deploy or commercialize them,\\\\nmaking it essential to detect Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. Most\\\\nexisting ownership protection solutions, such as watermarks, are designed for\\\\nrelational databases and texts. They cannot be directly applied to RAGs because\\\\nrelational database watermarks require white-box access to detect IP\\\\ninfringement, which is unrealistic for the knowledge base in RAGs. Meanwhile,\\\\npost-processing by the adversary\\\\\\'s deployed LLMs typically destructs text\\\\nwatermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box\\\\n\"knowledge watermark\" approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of\\\\nRAGs.
